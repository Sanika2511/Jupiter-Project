## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling of bike rental demand. My goal is to build models that accurately estimate hourly bike rental counts based on various features like temperature, humidity, and time of day.

Key features and steps include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distributions and relationships.
- Building predictive models using linear regression and decision trees.
- Feature engineering to extract valuable insights from the datetime variable.
- Model evaluation using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE).
- Generating predictions for bike rental demand on a test dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this project, you'll need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanika2511/bike-rental-prediction.git

Install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Usage
To use the project and generate predictions, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the "notebooks" folder.
Execute the cells to perform the analysis and build predictive models.
Review the results and generate predictions for the test dataset.
Model Evaluation
I assess the performance of my models using RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) as the evaluation metric.

  
### Submission
For submission and scoring, you can use the provided Excel file and follow the instructions in the notebook.
